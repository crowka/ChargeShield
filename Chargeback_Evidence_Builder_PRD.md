# Chargeback Evidence Builder ‚Äî PRD (v1)

## 1. Problem
Merchants lose revenue to chargebacks, spending hours assembling inconsistent evidence. Built‚Äëins are basic; managed recovery often demands high rev‚Äëshare.

## 2. Solution
Connect store and PSP, ingest disputes, auto‚Äëassemble bank‚Äëready evidence from orders, shipment and session/device data, submit via APIs, and track outcomes with win‚Äërate analytics.

- Additions (v1.1):
  - Issuer/network‚Äëspecific briefs, with explicit mapping to reason codes.
  - Partial‚Äë and duplicate‚Äërefund detection with supporting receipts/ARNs included in packets.
  - Optional pre‚Äëdispute alert integrations to deflect (auto‚Äërefund thresholds) before chargeback.
  - Transparent ‚ÄúWhat we submit‚Äù packet preview and immutable archive for every submission.

## 3. Users & Roles
- Merchant Owner/Admin: billing, configuration
- Ops/Support Agent: reviews evidence drafts, submits/edits
- Agency Partner Admin (optional): manages multiple stores (white‚Äëlabel)

## 4. Web Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Backend: Supabase (Auth, Postgres + RLS, Storage, Edge Functions/workers)
- Integrations: Shopify Admin API, Stripe Disputes/Webhooks; carriers (UPS/USPS) optional; pre‚Äëdispute alert providers (optional)
- Billing: Shopify App Billing (if Shopify), Stripe Billing (non‚ÄëShopify)

## 5. Auth & User Management
- Supabase Auth for app sign‚Äëin; Shopify OAuth for store connection; Stripe OAuth for PSP.
- Role table per org; RLS on disputes by org.

## 6. Data Model (core)
- `orgs`, `users`, `user_org_roles`
- `stores(id, org_id, platform, oauth_tokens, status)`
- `disputes(id, org_id, store_id, psp_id, reason_code, amount, due_by, status)`
- `orders(id, org_id, store_id, customer_json, items_json, addresses_json)`
- `evidence_items(id, dispute_id, type, content_path|json)`
- `submissions(id, dispute_id, submitted_at, method, status, receipt)`
- `analytics_winrates(id, org_id, period, reason_code, win_rate)`
- `audit_events(...)`
- `refund_events(id, dispute_id, amount, created_at, method, external_ref)`
- `alerts(id, org_id, store_id, provider, external_id, received_at, status, decision)`
- `submission_packets(id, submission_id, sha256, storage_path)`

## 7. Payments
- Shopify App Billing (recurring + usage tiers) when installed via Shopify.
- Stripe Billing otherwise (monthly plan + per‚Äëdispute add‚Äëon).
